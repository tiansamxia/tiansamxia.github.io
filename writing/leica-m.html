      <div>
        <p>Compact, reliable, timeless — those are some of the qualities people often associate with Leica M cameras. Even if you haven’t heard of the camera or the brand, you may still have seen its iconic images: from Che Guevara to Muhammad Ali; from Paris to Vietnam.</p>
        <p>As design, Leica M is the epitome of progress through iteration: the camera’s form is largely unchanged in over 60 years, while its function continuously improved and evolved, including the switch from analog to digital 15 years ago. It’s the Porsche 911 of cameras — both in reputation and in philosophy.</p>

        <h1>Leica M3</h1>
        <h2 class="color-mid width-720 margin-top-0">1954</h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>The original M. “M” stands for <em>Messsucher</em>, a compound from German words <em>Entfernungsmesser</em> (“rangefinder”) and <em>Sucher</em> (“viewfinder”). It highlights the technological innovation that separates the M3 from previous Leicas: a combined view- and rangefinder, allowing the photographer to focus and compose simultaneously.</p>
        <p>The viewfinder on the M3 has a magnification of 0.91× — the highest of all M cameras. It offers three framelines: 50 mm, 90 mm, and 135 mm, automatically shown when the respective lens is mounted. Parallax compensation shifts the framelines as you focus from 0.7 m to infinity, ensuring accurate composition.</p>
        <p>Also debuting on the M3 is the new M lens mount. The bayonet mount replaces the screw mount of previous Leicas, allowing fast lens switching and creating a standard for compatibility. Every M camera from 1954 onward can work with almost any M lens — made by Leica or not — from the past seven decades, making the M system a long-lasting, and consequently, environment-friendly investment.</p>
        <p>In 1957, Leica released the M2, a simplified model with a 0.72× magnification viewfinder and framelines for 35 mm, 50 mm, and 90 mm.</p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <p>The first evolutionary milestone of the M. Underneath the M4’s familiar silhouette are numerous improvements: an angled film rewind crank replaces the knob, allowing faster rewinding; a redesigned loading mechanism makes reloading film easier; the viewfinder, same 0.72× magnification as the M2, now includes four framelines — 35 mm, 50 mm, 90 mm, and 135 mm.</p>
        <p>Like the M3 and M2, the M4 also doesn’t feature a built-in exposure meter. Photographers need to rely on an external light meter for exposure — but that’s about to change.</p>

      <div>
        <p>The first Leica M with a built-in light meter. However, due to the techonology at the time, the M5 is noticeably larger and heavier than all other analog M cameras. This contributed to its unpopularity among M photographers (and poor sales), despite it being the most technologically advanced M to its date.</p>
        <p>Alongside the M5, Leica partnered with Minolta to produce the CL (1973), a compact, budget-friendly model featuring the same lens mount as M cameras and compatible with M lenses.</p>

        <p>M returning to its classic form. The M6 is everything the M5 wanted to be: state-of-the-art technology fitted into the same, familiar form factor. That created one of the most popular M cameras even to this day; all it took was 13 years of research & development and a near-death experience for the company.</p>
        <p>Following the M6, Leica released an upgraded version in 1998 (commonly referred to as M6 “TTL”), adding through-the-lens (TTL) flash metering support.</p>

        <p>The mechanical perfection. For many, the M7 is too advanced, relying a little too much on the electronics (and the battery). What if you want the simplicity of the M6, but the build quality and the improved viewfinder of the M7? The answer: MP. Battery is only needed for exposure metering; the rest of the camera is fully functional without one. As long as you can still buy film stock, that is.</p>
        <p>The MP is the pinnacle of analog M photography — a pure, beautifully crafted masterpiece that will likely outlast its owner.</p>

        <p>The beginning of the digital era for M. Like the M5, the M8 was the biggest technological shift to its date since the M3; unlike the M5, this time everything still looks familiar — from the front, at least. The M8 is almost indistinguishable from an analog M until viewed from the back: there, an LCD screen gives it away. On the top, there’s also a small, circular display where the film rewinder used to be, telling the battery level and the remaining storage space on the SD card. Welcome to the digital M.</p>
        <p>Fun fact: the image sensor used in the M8 is made by Kodak. Yes, <em>that</em> Kodak.</p>

      <div>
        <p>The first full-frame digital M. While the M8 reassured Leica fans of the M legacy continuing into the digital age, it had one <em>small</em> drawback: it featured a “cropped” sensor. At 27 × 18 mm, it is smaller than the 135 film format (36 × 24 mm), pioneered by Oskar Barnack of Leica in 1913 and used by every M since. The M9 pacifies those declaring heresy: it now features an image sensor (also made by Kodak) the same size as a frame of the 135 film — hence <em>full-frame</em>.</p>
        <p>Another bug-fix: the M9 no longer requires an external IR-cut filter in front of the lens to reproduce colors accurately, as its new sensor can effectively block infrared light. Unless you consider infrared photography on the M8 a feature, not a bug.</p>

        <p>The M back to its essentials. After experimenting with various new technologies on the M Typ 240 (2012) series of cameras, Leica refocused on what fans love the most about an M: slim body, tactile controls, quiet shutter, simple interface — thinning the layer between the image and the photographer as much as possible. The resulting M10 is a “greatest hits” of all M cameras to date.</p>
        <p>But it also doesn’t stand still — no numbered-M ever did. The M10 features a brand new, low-noise image sensor, first at the same 24 megapixel as the previous generation, later at a much higher 40 megapixel with the M10-R (2020). On the top, an ISO sensitivity dial sits where the film rewinder used to be, offering physical, tactile control when most other digital cameras resort to software menus. It even has built-in Wi-Fi connectivity, allowing you to control the camera remotely or transfer images directly to your phone. Who says an old (looking) dog can’t learn new tricks.</p>
