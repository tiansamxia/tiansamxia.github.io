        <p>Some fundamental reflections on the — all things considered — essence of design which determined me and my fellow designers was summed up in ten simple statements a few years ago. They are helpful a means for orientation and understanding. They are not binding. Good design is in a constant state of redevelopment — just like technology and culture.</p>

      <h3>Good design is innovative.</h3>
      <p>The possibilities for innovation are not, ​by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. ​But innovative design always develops ​in tandem with innovative technology, ​and can never be an end in itself.</p>

      <h3>Good design makes a product useful.</h3>
      <p>A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.</p>

      <h3>Good design is aesthetic.</h3>
      <p>The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.</p>

      <h3>Good design makes a product understandable.</h3>
      <p>It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.</p>

      <h2 class="text-large">5</h2>
      <h3>Good design is honest.</h3>
      <p>It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.</p>
    </section>
      
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-large">6</h2>
      <h3>Good design is unobtrusive.</h3>
      <p>Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user’s self-expression.</p>

      <h2 class="text-large">7</h2>
      <h3>Good design is long-lasting.</h3>
      <p>It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years — even in today’s throwaway society.</p>

      <h3>Good design is thorough down to the last detail.</h3>
      <p>Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the consumer.</p>

      <h2 class="text-large">9</h2>
      <h3>Good design is environmentally friendly.</h3>
      <p>Good design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.</p>
    </section>
      
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-large">10</h2>
      <h3>Good design is as little design as possible.</h3>
      <p>Less but better — because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with inessentials.</p>
      <p>Back to purity, back to simplicity!</p>
