        </hgroup>
        <p>I started on the Pet Health team at Chewy, where I focused on pharmacy customers buying prescription medications and food for their pets. My work spanned across various touchpoints in their shopping journey, from product detail pages to cart and checkout.</p>
        <p>In 2023, I joined a project that became <a href="/work/chewy-vet-care.html">Chewy Vet Care</a>, Chewy’s brick-and-mortar veterinary clinics. I was the design owner of an online portal that enabled customers to schedule appointments, manage prescriptions, and access health records for their pets. Chewy Vet Care opened its doors in April 2024.</p>
        <p class="margin-bottom-2x">Today, I’m part of the Enterprise Platforms team, designing tools for our internal customers. Currently, I’m supporting applications used by category managers, operations, and finance to launch and manage promotions across Chewy.</p>

        <p>I joined Axon to build its first standalone software product, <a href="/work/axon-records.html">Axon Records</a>, a records management system designed for law enforcement. My focus was on the officer experience, which included report writing, real-time collaboration, and federal compliance. Axon Records was launched at the Fresno Police Department in September 2019.</p>
        <p class="margin-bottom-2x">In 2021, I transferred to the platform team at Axon to lead design for its design system and foundational services, such as account management, authentication, and cloud storage.</p>
