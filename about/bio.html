    <h2>Hello, I’m Sam.</h2>
    <p>I’m a product designer making software systems for public safety at <a href="https://www.axon.com" target="_blank">Axon</a> in Seattle, Washington.</p>
    <p>Previously, I worked at <a href="https://www.davita.com" target="_blank">DaVita</a>, a healthcare provider headquartered in Denver, Colorado. I was part of a team designing and building the next-gen electronic health records (EHR) & clinical admin system for clinicians working in DaVita’s kidney dialysis centers.</p>
    <p>Before that, I was a UX specialist at <a href="https://www.universalmind.com" target="_blank">Universal Mind</a>, a digital design agency in Denver. There I had the privilege to work with clients including Herman Miller, Western Union, and Complete Genomics on products across mobile, desktop, and web.</p>
    <p>I graduated from Indiana University’s HCI/design master’s program in 2014, and I’ve been working in design since. Before coming to the United States, I studied electronics engineering in Beijing, away from my hometown of Urumqi, a city in northwest China.</p>
    <p>As a child, I was always fascinated by machines and how they worked. That curiosity led me into the world of computers and engineering. But by the time I graduated from college, I became convinced that technology alone was not enough; that to make machines easy to work with, I needed to understand the humans who use them. That’s how I ended up in design.</p>
    <p>Besides design, I’m fervently passionate about photography. To me, it’s the perfect marriage of technology and art: the former provides the vessel, and the latter fills it with form and meaning; the two are complementary and inseparable. By itself, a camera is nothing more than a light-gathering box; but in the right hands, it can preserve the most beautiful moments otherwise lost in time.</p>
    <p>Thanks for visiting.
