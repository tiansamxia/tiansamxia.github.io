          <p>Compact, discreet, reliable — for seven decades, the Leica M cameras have defined the rangefinder category and shaped the history of photography. The M’s concept — fitting the most advanced technology into the smallest possible package — has won over loyal fans, including many renowned photographers: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Elliot Erwitt, Josef Koudelka, Alex Webb, to name a few.</p>
          <p>Since its introduction in 1954, the Leica M has witnessed wars, peace, triumphs, defeats, and anything in between. Its value — a compact and nimble tool that gets out of the photographer’s way, wherever they go — is best demonstrated through the iconic images it has created. Che Guevara, Muhammad Ali, children fleeing napalm attacks in Vietnam, a man holding a book in his mouth in New York — many of these are moments only an M can capture.</p>
          <p>Over nearly 70 years, the M’s appearance has barely changed while the technology inside has evolved constantly — some more drastic than others, such as the switch from analog to digital. Evolution, rather than revolution, is the M’s philosophy: just like a Porsche 911, every generation is unquestionably better than the last while feeling unmistakably part of the family. It is the epitome of progress through iteration.</p>

            <p>The original M. “M” stands for <em>Messsucher</em>, a compound from German words <em>Entfernungsmesser</em> (“rangefinder”) and <em>Sucher</em> (“viewfinder”). It highlights the technological innovation that separates the M3 from previous Leicas: a combined view- and rangefinder, allowing the photographer to focus and compose simultaneously.</p>
            <p>The viewfinder on the M3 has a magnification of 0.91× — the highest of all M cameras. It offers three framelines: 50 mm, 90 mm, and 135 mm, automatically shown when the respective lens is mounted. Parallax compensation shifts the framelines as you focus from 0.7 m to infinity, ensuring accurate composition.</p>
            <p>Also debuting on the M3 is the new M lens mount. The bayonet mount replaces the screw mount of previous Leicas, allowing fast lens switching and creating a standard for compatibility. Every M camera from 1954 onward can work with almost any M lens — made by Leica or not — from the past seven decades, making the M system a long-lasting, and consequently, environment-friendly investment.</p>
            <p>In 1957, Leica released the M2, a simplified model with a 0.72× magnification viewfinder and framelines for 35 mm, 50 mm, and 90 mm lenses.</p>

            <p>The M formula, refined. Underneath the M4’s familiar silhouette are numerous improvements: an angled rewind crank replaces the knob, allowing faster film rewinding; a redesigned takeup mechanism makes reloading film easier; the viewfinder, same 0.72× magnification as the M2, now includes four framelines — 35 mm, 50 mm, 90 mm, and 135 mm.</p>
            <p>Like the M3 and M2, the M4 also doesn’t have a built-in exposure meter. Photographers who needed precise exposure control had to rely on an external light meter — but that’s about to change.</p>

            <p>The metered M. The M5 features a built-in exposure meter, measured with a CdS cell on a swing arm in front of the shutter curtain. Reading from the meter appears at the bottom of the viewfinder along with shutter speed, allowing the photographer to change exposure settings without removing the eye from the finder.</p>
            <p>However, fitting all the new technology inside means increased size and weight: the M5 is the largest and heaviest M camera ever made. As a result, it is less popular among photographers, despite its excellent build quality and advanced features.</p>
            <p>Alongside the M5, Leica partnered with Minolta in Japan to produce the Leica CL (1973), a more compact and affordable model featuring the same lens mount as M cameras.</p>
            <p>Leica ended the production of the M5 in 1975 due to poor sales and reverted to making meter-less M models based on the M4 (M4-2 and M4-P).</p>

            <p>The metered M, take two. After struggling sales and nearly a death sentence for its rangefinder system, Leica returned in 1984 with the M6. It addresses the biggest complaint of its predecessor: it looks like an M again.</p>
            <p>Thirteen years of progress means it’s now possible to increase function without changing the form. Side by side, the M6 is almost identical to the M4 in both size and weight; the only visual difference is the battery compartment on the front — to power the built-in meter.</p>
            <p>It’s hardly a surprise, then: the M6 went on to become one of the most popular M models of all time. Classic design combined with the convenience of the exposure meter makes the M6 especially welcomed by newcomers to the M system.</p>
            <p>Following the M6, Leica released an upgraded version in 1998 (commonly referred to as M6 “TTL”), adding through-the-lens (TTL) flash metering functionality.</p>

            <p>At the heart of the M8 is a 27 x 18 mm, 10.3-megapixel CCD image sensor made by Kodak. Yes — the same Kodak that makes Ektachrome films. A unique feature of the M8’s sensor is its ultrathin filter stack. It does away with a Moiré filter, which helps retain the maximum pixel acuity.</p>
            <p>A new 0.68× magnification viewfinder accommodates the APS-H format sensor with 24 mm, 28 mm, 35 mm, 50 mm, 75 mm, and 90 mm framelines. In practice, these are equivalent to lenses 1.33× their focal lengths (a 24 mm lens is equivalent to a 32 mm on a film Leica, and so on).</p>

            <p>The digital M, version 2.0. As faithful as the M8 stays to the M’s heritage, there’s one <em>small</em> problem: its image sensor is not the same size as a frame of 135 film — the format pioneered by Oskar Barnack in 1913 on the Ur-Leica. The M9 corrects that.</p>
            <p>At 36 × 24 mm, the M9’s image sensor (still made by Kodak) matches the film size and utilizes the entire imaging area of an M lens. The total pixel count increases to 18 megapixels while each pixel remains the same size as the M8.</p>
            <p>With the “full-frame” sensor, the M9’s viewfinder also returned to the same frameline configuration as the M6/M7/MP: 28 mm, 35 mm, 50 mm, 75 mm, 90 mm, and 135 mm. Magnification remains at the same 0.68× as the M8.</p>
            <p>Last but not least: the M9’s sensor features a redesigned filter stack that effectively cuts infrared light, eliminating the M8’s color-shift issue (some black fabrics will appear purple in the images, for example).</p>

            <p>The M’s return to the essentials. After experimenting with various new technologies on the M (Typ 240) series, Leica refocused the M10 on what generations of photographers loved about an M — slim body, quiet shutter, tactile controls, simple operation. The result: a perfect fusion of old and new.</p>
            <p>Inside the M10, a low-noise CMOS image sensor replaces the CCD units found on the M8 and M9, with 24 megapixels (later 40 megapixels on the M10-R) and a top ISO of 50,000. A new, 0.73× magnification viewfinder with LED-illuminated framelines elevates the rangefinder experience, while a <em>live view</em> function enables precise composition and focusing.</p>
            <p>On the top, an ISO dial lives where the film rewinder used to be, providing direct, tactile control. Gone is the movie function — the M10 is squarely focused on still photography. The simplification continues on the back with the three-button interface layout, balancing physical input and ease of use.</p>
            <p>Underneath its simplicity, the M10 offers state-of-the-art technology. The camera has Wi-Fi connectivity for remote control and wireless transfer of images. The hot shoe has hidden contacts for connecting an electronic viewfinder — which can also send GPS data to the camera.</p>

            <p>A new beginning for the M. Underneath its familiar appearance, the M11 breaks several traditions in the M’s lineage. Gone is the removable bottom plate, a heritage from the film era, which made it unnecessarily difficult to access the SD card or change the battery.</p>
            <p>Not that you need to do either of those frequently on the M11: it comes with 64 GB of internal storage, plus a USB-C port which supports both data transfer and charging.</p>
            <p>Also debuting on the M11: a back-illuminated, 60-megapixel image sensor with wide dynamic range. If the full resolution is an overkill, the M11 can also record images at 36 or 18 megapixels.</p>
            <p>Like a mirrorless camera, the M11 always uses its image sensor for exposure metering, another first for the M. This gathers far more data than the simple metering sensor on previous M cameras, allowing for more sophisticated and accurate metering algorithms.</p>
