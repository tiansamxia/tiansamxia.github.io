        <p>Royale with Cheese is a poster I designed and printed with letterpress. The theme of the project was “your favorite movie quote.” I selected the quote from Quentin Tarantino’s film, <em>Pulp Fiction</em>.</p>
        <p>The poster features a silhouette of character Jules Winnfield (played by Samuel L. Jackson) made out of his lines from the “Room 49” scene leading up to the quote, “Royale with Cheese.”</p>
        <p>The silhouette was an abstraction based on a fan poster by Daniel Bennett, which referenced a shot from the aforementioned scene in the film.</p>
        <p>The inspiration for the typefaces came from the film’s title (for the main quote) and McDonald’s hamburger packaging (for the silhouette lines).</p>
        <p>I used gold ink as it’s the color of both <em>royale</em> and <em>cheese</em>, and I matched it with black to create the light and dark tones that make up the silhouette.</p>
        <p>Two photopolymer plates — one for each color — were designed digitally, developed on film, then etched and mounted on the press bed. Each poster needed to be printed twice, with careful alignment between the runs.</p>
        <p class="margin-bottom-0">Finally, the finished posters were cut and signed.</p>
